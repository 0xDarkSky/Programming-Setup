# Programming-Setup

So you recently began programming, or you're just looking for the best setup, and here you found this repository.

First of all, you'll need a text editor (an IDE or just a simple text editor).

*Note that all of the text editors/IDE's below are open-source, released on Github*

# Minimal text editors

For the minimal editors, something that doesn't use much system resources, we have these editors:

**Vim** might be a bit difficult to use first, so make sure to read the docs. Although it's pretty good, definitely not bloat as well.

**Neovim** (basically a fork of Vim, some people prefer it over Vim)

**Nano** quite easy to use, as minimal as it gets

# IDE's

**VsCodium** basically a fork of VS Code (looks exactly like VS Code but removed telemetry and other bloat stuff). Just better, I use it myself and I recommend giving this one a try.

**Atom** an IDE that just works, nice and easy to use.

**Emacs** old but gold, might be a bit difficult to use, but definitely worth trying.

**CodeLite** I haven't used this one much, but it's pretty good for those who code in C/C++.

**That's pretty much it, feel free to open up an issue if I forgot to include something.**
